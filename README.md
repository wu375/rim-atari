# Recurrent Independent Mechanisms and atari-ppo training
My implementation of [Recurrent Independent Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10893.pdf) and visualization of memory usage

There are 6 blocks below the gameplay indicating which of them are activated. \
White => activated \
Black => inactive \
<br/>
Both are trained without recurrent connections. So far training without recurrent bptt is giving higher results.
